    { question: "How much does a custom exhibition stand cost in Dubai?", answer: "The cost for a custom exhibition stand in Dubai can range from AED 45,000 for a small, simple design to over AED 500,000 for a large, complex double-decker pavilion. The final price depends on size, material quality, AV technology, and complexity. We provide a detailed, transparent quote after our initial consultation." },
    { question: "What is the typical timeline for a custom stand project?", answer: "From design approval, a typical custom stand project takes 4-6 weeks for fabrication and production. This includes 3D modeling, revisions, material procurement, manufacturing, and graphics printing. We recommend starting the process at least 8-12 weeks before your event." },
    { question: "Can FANN handle the entire process from design to installation?", answer: "Yes, absolutely. Our turnkey service covers every aspect of your project. We manage the initial concept, 3D design, fabrication, logistics, on-site installation at venues like DWTC, and post-show dismantling. This provides you with a single point of contact and a stress-free experience." },
    { question: "What kind of materials can be used for a bespoke stand?", answer: "We work with a vast range of high-quality materials to match your brand aesthetic. This includes premium woods, custom laminates, brushed metals (like bronze and aluminum), acrylics, tension fabrics for graphics, and advanced AV elements like seamless LED screens." },
    { question: "Why should I choose a custom stand over a modular system?", answer: "A custom stand offers unparalleled brand expression and impact. It's uniquely designed to meet your specific marketing objectives, showcase products perfectly, and create an immersive visitor experience. While modular stands offer reusability, custom stands provide the 'wow' factor that makes you stand out in a crowded exhibition hall." },
    { question: "Do you have experience at major Dubai venues?", answer: "Yes, we are seasoned experts at all major UAE venues, especially the Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC) and Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC). We have a deep understanding of their regulations, logistical procedures, and technical guidelines, ensuring a smooth and compliant build process." },
    { question: "How involved will I be in the design process?", answer: "As involved as you wish to be. Our process is collaborative. We start with your brief, present initial concepts, and refine the 3D models based on your feedback. We provide regular updates throughout fabrication, ensuring the final product perfectly aligns with your vision." },
    { question: "Can you incorporate interactive technology into the stand?", answer: "Definitely. We specialize in integrating cutting-edge technology to enhance visitor engagement. This includes interactive touchscreens, VR/AR experiences, holographic displays, motion sensor activations, and custom-programmed LED lighting to create a dynamic and memorable stand." }

  { question: "What is the difference between stand fabrication and interior fit-out?", answer: "Fabrication is the process of building the main structure of the stand. Interior fit-out is the next stage, focusing on the 'finishing touches' that make the space functional and aesthetically pleasing. This includes flooring, wall finishes, lighting installation, branding, and furnishing—essentially, turning the raw structure into a complete, ready-to-use environment." },
  { question: "Can you provide fit-out services for a stand built by another company?", answer: "While we typically provide fit-out as part of our turnkey solution, we can offer our finishing services for stands built by other contractors, subject to a technical review. Our expertise can significantly elevate the final look and feel of any structure." },
  { question: "What kind of flooring options do you offer?", answer: "We offer a wide range of flooring solutions suitable for exhibitions, including custom-printed vinyl, premium carpeting and carpet tiles, raised wooden or composite flooring for a premium feel, and durable laminate options. The choice depends on your budget, branding, and expected footfall." },
  { question: "How do you handle branding and signage within the fit-out?", answer: "Branding is a key part of our fit-out service. We produce and install all forms of signage, including 3D logos, vinyl wall graphics, fabric prints, and directional signage, ensuring your brand messaging is clear, consistent, and professionally presented." },
  { question: "What's involved in your project management for fit-out?", answer: "Our project manager coordinates all aspects of the fit-out, including scheduling different trades (electricians, painters, flooring specialists), managing material deliveries, and ensuring all work is completed to a high standard and in accordance with the event's timeline and safety regulations." },
  { question: "Can you create high-end hospitality areas within a stand?", answer: "Yes, creating premium hospitality and VIP lounge areas is one of our specialties. Our fit-out service includes the installation of custom-built bars, comfortable seating areas, high-end finishes, and ambient lighting to create an exclusive and welcoming space for your most important guests." },
  { question: "How long does the fit-out process take on-site?", answer: "The on-site fit-out timeline varies depending on the complexity, but it is a core part of the overall build-up schedule. For a typical stand, this can range from 1 to 3 days. We meticulously plan this phase to ensure efficiency and completion well before the show opening." },
  { question: "Do you offer sustainable fit-out options?", answer: "Yes, we are committed to sustainability. We can offer eco-friendly fit-out solutions, including sourcing recycled or sustainable materials for flooring and finishes, using low-VOC paints, and recommending energy-efficient LED lighting systems." }
